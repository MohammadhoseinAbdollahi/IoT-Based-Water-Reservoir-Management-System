# Project Requirements

## Objectives
- Automate water reservoir monitoring and management.
- Use simulated sensors to collect data.
- Enable edge computation for gate control.

## Sensors
- pH Sensor: Monitors water quality.
- Rainfall Sensor: Measures rainfall intensity.
- Water Level Sensor: Tracks water levels.
- Temperature Sensor: Logs water temperature.

## System Architecture
- Sensors → Edge Computation → Backend → Visualization
- Real-time alerts and control via Node-red and Thingworx.
